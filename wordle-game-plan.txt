Wordle

// GAMEPLAY
// At the beginning of the app, the users see the game grid, so they know they're at the right app.

// The user will be able to click on the "Start Game" button, to begin the game.

// Players may not use words that are not available in the data. They will receive messages telling them they may not
use the word if they attempt it.

// Players must click a "Submit" button if they have selected their word, in order to move on with the game. The game will add their word
to the grid, and an attempt will be removed.

// Game continues in this pattern until the correct word is found or the user runs out of attempts. When that happens, the game will display
a message letting the user know whether the user won or lost, as well as display the winning word. 

// After the game ends, a reset button is available to reset the game and allow the user to play again.


// SETUP
// The players start with a grid of squares, 6x5. Six is the number of attempts the player has to guess the word, 
and five is the number of letters allowed in each attempt.

// A data array contains all the possible five letter words that can be used. A random word is chosen from the data to be the winning 
word for the game.

// The game will display which letters have are in the winning word or if they're in the proper position with background colors on each word..

// Game compares the winning word with the user's guess through comparing arrays.

// Expect heavy use of event listeners for this app, due to all the clicking users will be doing.



// Possible enhancements after all of this is done:

// Add some kind of theme
// Get data from somewhere online, maybe use an API
